      "content=\"Gravity is a fundamental force of nature that governs the interaction between masses, causing objects with mass to attract each other. According to Albert Einstein's theory of general relativity, gravity is not a force that acts between objects, but rather a curvature of spacetime caused by the presence of mass and energy. The more massive an object is, the greater its gravitational pull, and the stronger it warps the fabric of spacetime around it. This curvature affects not only objects with mass but also light and other forms of energy, leading to phenomena such as gravitational lensing and gravitational waves. Gravity plays a crucial role in shaping our planet's structure, holding planets in orbit around their stars, and governing the motion of celestial bodies throughout the universe.\" additional_kwargs={'refusal': None} response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 149, 'prompt_tokens': 40, 'total_tokens': 189, 'completion_tokens_details': None, 'prompt_tokens_details': None}, 'model_name': 'llama3.2:3b', 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_ollama', 'finish_reason': 'stop', 'logprobs': None} id='run-fe8b3522-5976-4a60-aa71-ba5566d1f85f-0' usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 40, 'output_tokens': 149, 'total_tokens': 189, 'input_token_details': {}, 'output_token_details': {}}\n"
