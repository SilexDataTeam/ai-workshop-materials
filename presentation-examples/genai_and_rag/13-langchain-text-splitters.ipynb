These settlers quickly established an extensive fur trading network with the local Native Americans, but by the 1740s the settlement had largely been abandoned.[[29]](#cite_note-33)  \\nIn 1779, explorers [James Robertson](/wiki/James_Robertson_%28explorer%29 \"James Robertson (explorer)\") and [John Donelson](/wiki/John_Donelson \"John Donelson\") led a party of [Overmountain Men](/wiki/Overmountain_Men \"Overmountain Men\") to the site of French Lick, and constructed [Fort Nashborough](/wiki/Fort_Nashborough \"Fort Nashborough\"). It was named for [Francis Nash](/wiki/Francis_Nash \"Francis Nash\"), the [American Revolutionary War](/wiki/American_Revolutionary_War \"American Revolutionary War\") hero. Nashville quickly grew because of its strategic location as a port on the [Cumberland River](/wiki/Cumberland_River \"Cumberland River\"), a tributary of the [Ohio River](/wiki/Ohio_River \"Ohio River\"); and its later status as a major railroad center. By 1800, the city had 345 residents, including 136 enslaved African Americans and 14 free African Americans.[[30]](#cite_note-SP1L132-34) In 1806, Nashville was [incorporated](/wiki/Municipal_corporation \"Municipal corporation\") as a city and became the [county seat](/wiki/County_seat \"County seat\") of [Davidson County, Tennessee](/wiki/Davidson_County%2C_Tennessee \"Davidson County, Tennessee\").

There were 311 deaths from cholera in 1849[[34]](#cite_note-38)[[35]](#cite_note-NashCityCemetery-39) and an estimated 316 to about 500 in 1850.[[36]](#cite_note-Bowling1866-40)  \\nBefore the Civil War, about 700 free [Blacks](/wiki/Free_people_of_color \"Free people of color\") lived in small enclaves in northern Nashville. More than 3,200 enslaved African Americans lived in the city.[[37]](#cite_note-BitterSoutherner-41) By 1860, when the first [rumblings of secession](/wiki/American_Civil_War \"American Civil War\") began to be heard across the [South](/wiki/Southern_United_States \"Southern United States\"), antebellum Nashville was a prosperous city.  \\nThe city\\'s significance as a shipping port and rail center made it a desirable prize for competing military forces that wanted to control the region\\'s important river and railroad transportation routes. In February 1862, Nashville became the first Confederate state capital to fall to [U.S.](/wiki/Union_%28American_Civil_War%29 \"Union (American Civil War)\") troops, and the state was occupied by the U.S. Army for the duration of the war. Many enslaved African Americans from Middle Tennessee fled as refugees to Union lines; they were housed in contraband camps around military installations in Nashville\\'s eastern, western, and southern borders. The [Battle of Nashville](/wiki/Battle_of_Nashville \"Battle of Nashville\") (December 15–16, 1864) was a significant Union victory and perhaps the most decisive tactical victory gained by either side in the war; it was also the war\\'s final major military action in which Tennessee regiments played a large part on both sides of the battle. Afterward, the Confederates conducted a [war of attrition](/wiki/War_of_attrition \"War of attrition\"), making [guerrilla](/wiki/Guerrilla \"Guerrilla\") raids and engaging in small skirmishes. Confederate forces in the [Deep South](/wiki/Deep_South \"Deep South\") were almost constantly in retreat.  \\nIn 1868, three years after the end of the Civil War, the Nashville chapter of the [Ku Klux Klan](/wiki/Ku_Klux_Klan \"Ku Klux Klan\") was founded by Confederate veteran [John W. Morton](/wiki/John_W._Morton_%28Tennessee_politician%29 \"John W. Morton (Tennessee politician)\"). He was reported to have initiated General [Nathan Bedford Forrest](/wiki/Nathan_Bedford_Forrest \"Nathan Bedford Forrest\") into the white-sepremacist organization.[[38]](#cite_note-tennesseanobit-42) The latter became Grand Wizard of the organization, which had chapters of this secret, [insurgent](/wiki/Insurgent \"Insurgent\") group forming throughout the state and across the South. They opposed voting and political organizing by [freedmen](/wiki/Freedmen \"Freedmen\"), tried to control their behavior by threats, violence and murder, and sometimes also attacked their White allies, including schoolteachers from the North and Freedman\\'s Bureau officials.  \\nWhites directed violence against freedmen and their descendants both during and after the [Reconstruction era](/wiki/Reconstruction_era \"Reconstruction era\"). Two freedmen, [David Jones](/wiki/Lynching_of_David_Jones \"Lynching of David Jones\") and [Jo Reed](/wiki/Lynching_of_Jo_Reed \"Lynching of Jo Reed\"), were lynched in Nashville by White mobs in 1872 and 1875, respectively.[[39]](#cite_note-43)[[40]](#cite_note-44) Reed was hanged from a bridge over the river, but survived after the rope broke and he fell into the water. He successfully escaped the city soon thereafter.[[41]](#cite_note-45)  \\nIn the aftermath of the Civil War, the [Fisk Jubilee Singers](/wiki/Fisk_Jubilee_Singers \"Fisk Jubilee Singers\") of [Fisk University](/wiki/Fisk_University \"Fisk University\") in Nashville emerged as a beacon of hope and cultural pride. By 1871, this ensemble began touring the U.S. and Europe, earning international acclaim for their performances of [Negro spirituals](/wiki/Negro_spirituals \"Negro spirituals\").[[42]](#cite_note-46) Their success not only provided vital funding for their university[[43]](#cite_note-47) but also marked Nashville as a significant center for African American music and culture, laying the groundwork for the city\\'s enduring musical legacy.  \\nIn 1873, Nashville suffered another cholera epidemic, along with towns throughout Sumner County along railroad routes and the Cumberland River. This was part of a larger epidemic that struck the Mississippi Valley system and other areas of the United States, such as New York and towns along its major lakes and rivers. The epidemic is estimated to have killed around 1,000 people in Nashville,[[44]](#cite_note-48) and 50,000 total.  \\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1a/View_from_Capitol._Nashville%2C_Tennessee_%285614200862%29.jpg/220px-View_from_Capitol._Nashville%2C_Tennessee_%285614200862%29.jpg)](/wiki/File%3AView_from_Capitol._Nashville%2C_Tennessee_%285614200862%29.jpg)  \\nView from the [Tennessee State Capitol](/wiki/Tennessee_State_Capitol \"Tennessee State Capitol\") c.1865  \\nMeanwhile, the city had reclaimed its important shipping and trading position and developed a solid manufacturing base. The post–Civil War years of the late 19th century brought new prosperity to Nashville and Davidson County. Wealthy planters and businessmen built grand, classical-style buildings. A replica of the [Parthenon](/wiki/Parthenon_%28Nashville%29 \"Parthenon (Nashville)\") was constructed in [Centennial Park](/wiki/Centennial_Park_%28Nashville%29 \"Centennial Park (Nashville)\"), near downtown.[[45]](#cite_note-49)  \\nOn April 30, 1892, [Ephraim Grizzard](/wiki/Ephraim_Grizzard \"Ephraim Grizzard\"), an African-American man, was [lynched](/wiki/Lynching_in_the_United_States \"Lynching in the United States\") in a spectacle murder in front of a white mob of 10,000 in Nashville. He was a suspect in the assault of two white sisters.[[46]](#cite_note-richmondthemobhaditsway-50) His lynching was described by journalist [Ida B. Wells](/wiki/Ida_B._Wells \"Ida B.

In 1912, the [Tennessee Agricultural and Industrial and Normal School](/wiki/Tennessee_State_University \"Tennessee State University\") was moved to Jefferson Street.[[37]](#cite_note-BitterSoutherner-41) The first [Prince\\'s Hot Chicken Shack](/wiki/Prince%27s_Hot_Chicken_Shack \"Prince\\'s Hot Chicken Shack\") originated at the corner of Jefferson Street and 28th Avenue in 1945.[[37]](#cite_note-BitterSoutherner-41) Jefferson Street became a destination for jazz and blues musicians,[[37]](#cite_note-BitterSoutherner-41) and remained so until the federal government split the area by construction of [Interstate 40](/wiki/Interstate_40 \"Interstate 40\") in the late 1960s.[[52]](#cite_note-tennesseanfootpathbecame-56)  \\nIn 1925, the establishment of the [Grand Ole Opry](/wiki/Grand_Ole_Opry \"Grand Ole Opry\") marked the beginning of Nashville\\'s journey as the \\'Country Music Capital of the World\\',[[53]](#cite_note-57) drawing musicians and fans alike to the city and setting the stage for its future as a country music powerhouse.[[54]](#cite_note-58)  \\nIn 1950, the state legislature approved a new city charter that provided for the election of city council members from [single-member districts](/wiki/Single-member_district \"Single-member district\"), rather than [at-large](/wiki/At-large \"At-large\") voting. This change was supported because at-large voting required candidates to gain a majority of votes from across the city. The previous system prevented the minority population, which then tended to support Republican candidates, from being represented by candidates of their choice; apportionment under single-member districts meant that some districts in Nashville had Black majorities. In 1951, after passage of the new charter, African American attorneys [Z. Alexander Looby](/wiki/Z._Alexander_Looby \"Z. Alexander Looby\") and Robert E. Lillard were elected to the city council.[[55]](#cite_note-59)  \\nDuring the mid-1950s, Nashville underwent a musical transformation with the emergence of the \\'[Nashville Sound](/wiki/Nashville_sound \"Nashville sound\"),\\' which was characterized by \"smooth strings and choruses\", \"sophisticated background vocals\" and \"smooth tempos\" associated with [traditional pop](/wiki/Traditional_pop \"Traditional pop\").[[56]](#cite_note-60)[[57]](#cite_note-61) The new sound broadened country music\\'s appeal and solidified Nashville\\'s status as a music recording and production center.  \\nWith the United States Supreme Court ruling in 1954 that public schools had to desegregate with \"all deliberate speed\", the family of student Robert Kelley filed a lawsuit in 1956, arguing that Nashville administrators should open all-White East High School to him. A similar case was filed by [Reverend](/wiki/Reverend \"Reverend\") Henry Maxwell due to his children having to take a 45-minute bus ride from South Nashville to the north end of the city. These suits caused the courts to announce what became known as the \"Nashville Plan\", where the city\\'s public schools would desegregate one grade per year beginning in the fall of 1957.[[37]](#cite_note-BitterSoutherner-41)  \\nUrban redevelopment accelerated over the next several decades, and the city grew increasingly segregated. An interstate was placed on the edge of East Nashville while another highway was built through Edgehill, a lower-income, predominantly minority community.[[37]](#cite_note-BitterSoutherner-41)'),\n",

This resulted in a demand for many new schools and other support facilities, which the county found difficult to provide. At the same time, suburbanization led to a declining tax base in the city, although many suburban residents used unique city amenities and services that were supported financially only by city taxpayers. After years of discussion, a referendum was held in 1958 on the issue of consolidating city and county government. It failed to gain approval although it was supported by the then-elected leaders of both jurisdictions, County Judge [Beverly Briley](/wiki/Beverly_Briley \"Beverly Briley\") and Mayor [Ben West](/wiki/Ben_West \"Ben West\").[[58]](#cite_note-bucy-62)  \\nFollowing the referendum\\'s failure, Nashville annexed some 42 square miles of suburban jurisdictions to expand its tax base. This increased uncertainty among residents, and created resentment among many suburban communities. Under the second charter for metropolitan government, which was approved in 1962, two levels of service provision were proposed: the General Services District and the Urban Services District, to provide for a differential in tax levels. Residents of the Urban Services District had a full range of city services. The areas that made up the General Services District, however, had a lower tax rate until full services were provided.[[58]](#cite_note-bucy-62) This helped reconcile aspects of services and taxation among the differing jurisdictions within the large metro region.  \\nIn the early 1960s, Tennessee still had racial segregation of public facilities, including lunch counters and department store fitting rooms. Hotels and restaurants were also segregated. Between February 13 and May 10, 1960, [a series of sit-ins](/wiki/Nashville_sit-ins \"Nashville sit-ins\") were organized at lunch counters in downtown Nashville by the [Nashville Student Movement](/wiki/Nashville_Student_Movement \"Nashville Student Movement\") and Nashville Christian Leadership Council, and were part of a broader [sit-in movement](/wiki/Sit-in_movement \"Sit-in movement\") in the southeastern United States as part of an effort to end racial segregation of public facilities.[[59]](#cite_note-63) On April 19, 1960, the house of [Z. Alexander Looby](/wiki/Z._Alexander_Looby \"Z. Alexander Looby\"), an African American attorney and council member, was bombed by segregationists.[[60]](#cite_note-oshkoshblastwreckshome-64) Protesters marched to the city hall the next day. Mayor Ben West said he supported the desegregation of lunch counters, which civil rights activists had called for.[[61]](#cite_note-newspalladiumnashvillesmayorforintegration-65)  \\nIn 1963, Nashville consolidated its government with Davidson County, forming a [metropolitan government](/wiki/Consolidated_city-county \"Consolidated city-county\"). The membership on the Metro Council, the legislative body, was increased from 21 to 40 seats. Of these, five members are elected [at-large](/wiki/At-large \"At-large\") and 35 are elected from [single-member districts](/wiki/Single-member_district \"Single-member district\"), each to serve a term of four years.[[58]](#cite_note-bucy-62)  \\nAs Nashville evolved in the 1960s, its music scene diversified, welcoming [rock](/wiki/Rock_music \"Rock music\"), [pop](/wiki/Pop_music \"Pop music\"), and other genres and the \\'Nashville Sound\\' transformed into \\'[Countrypolitan](/wiki/Countrypolitan \"Countrypolitan\")\\'.

Of the city\\'s 33 towers of 300 feet tall or taller (as of April 2023), 24 have been completed since 2000. Of note, Nashville has a disproportionate number of buildings 300 feet and taller in relation to its overall metropolitan statistical area (MSA) population of about 2 million (2021 U.S. Census Bureau estimate). This is due, in part, to the tourism-centric city\\'s multiple hotel towers and to many condominium towers having multiple unit owners who also own other residential properties in both Nashville and in other markets. In contrast, and for comparison, Phoenix, with an MSA population of about 4.95 million (2021 estimate) offered 21 buildings of 300 feet and taller (as of late 2024).  \\nMany civic and infrastructure projects are being planned, in progress, or recently completed.

The combined entity is officially known as \"the Metropolitan Government of Nashville and Davidson County\", and is popularly known as \"Metro Nashville\" or simply \"Metro\". It offers services such as [police](/wiki/Metropolitan_Nashville_Police_Department \"Metropolitan Nashville Police Department\"), [fire](/wiki/Nashville_Fire_Department \"Nashville Fire Department\"), [electricity](/wiki/Nashville_Electric_Service \"Nashville Electric Service\"), water and sewage treatment. When the Metro government was formed in 1963, the government was split into two service districts—the \"urban services district\" and the \"general services district.\" The urban services district encompasses the 1963 boundaries of the former City of Nashville, approximately 72 square miles (190km2),[[245]](#cite_note-citypap20101121-254) and the general services district includes the remainder of Davidson County. There are six smaller municipalities within the consolidated city-county: [Belle Meade](/wiki/Belle_Meade%2C_Tennessee \"Belle Meade, Tennessee\"), [Berry Hill](/wiki/Berry_Hill%2C_Tennessee \"Berry Hill, Tennessee\"), [Forest Hills](/wiki/Forest_Hills%2C_Tennessee \"Forest Hills, Tennessee\"), [Oak Hill](/wiki/Oak_Hill%2C_Tennessee \"Oak Hill, Tennessee\"), [Goodlettsville](/wiki/Goodlettsville%2C_Tennessee \"Goodlettsville, Tennessee\") (partially), and [Ridgetop](/wiki/Ridgetop%2C_Tennessee \"Ridgetop, Tennessee\") (partially). These municipalities use a two-tier system of government, with the smaller municipality typically providing police services and the Metro Nashville government providing most other services. Previously, the city of [Lakewood](/wiki/Lakewood%2C_Tennessee \"Lakewood, Tennessee\") also had a separate charter. However, Lakewood residents voted in 2010 and 2011 to dissolve its city charter and join the metropolitan government, with both votes passing.[[246]](#cite_note-255)  \\nNashville is governed by a mayor, vice-mayor, and [40-member Metropolitan Council](/wiki/Metropolitan_Council_of_Nashville_and_Davidson_County \"Metropolitan Council of Nashville and Davidson County\"). It uses the strong-mayor form of the [mayor–council system](/wiki/Mayor%E2%80%93council_government \"Mayor–council government\").[[247]](#cite_note-256) The current mayor of Nashville is [Freddie O\\'Connell](/wiki/Freddie_O%27Connell \"Freddie O\\'Connell\").[[248]](#cite_note-257) The Metropolitan Council is the legislative body of government for Nashville and Davidson County. There are five council members who are elected at large and 35 council members that represent individual districts. The Metro Council has regular meetings that are presided over by the vice-mayor, who is currently Jim Shulman.

Pockets of Republican influence exist in the wealthier portions of the city, but they are usually no match for the overwhelming Democratic trend in the rest of the city. The issue of school busing roiled politics for years but subsided after the 1990s.[[249]](#cite_note-258) While local elections are officially nonpartisan, nearly all the city\\'s elected officials are publicly known as Democrats. The city is split among 10 state house districts, all of which are held by Democrats. Three state senate districts and part of a fourth are within the county; three are held by Democrats and one by a Republican.[[250]](#cite_note-259)  \\nIn the state legislature, Nashville politicians serve as leaders of both the [Senate](/wiki/Tennessee_Senate \"Tennessee Senate\") and [House](/wiki/Tennessee_House_of_Representatives \"Tennessee House of Representatives\") Democratic Caucuses. Representative Mike Stewart serves as Chairman of the House Caucus. Senator [Jeff Yarbro](/wiki/Jeff_Yarbro \"Jeff Yarbro\") serves as Chairman of the Senate Caucus.  \\nDemocrats are no less dominant at the federal level. Democratic presidential candidates have failed to carry Davidson County only five times since Reconstruction; in 1928, 1968, 1972, 1984 and 1988.[[251]](#cite_note-uselectionatlas.org-260) In most years, Democrats have carried Nashville at the presidential level with relatively little difficulty, even in years when they lose Tennessee as a whole. This has been especially true in recent elections, as the state capitol has continued to trend more Democratic even as most of the rest of the state has become staunchly Republican. In the [2000 presidential election](/wiki/2000_United_States_presidential_election \"2000 United States presidential election\"), Tennessean Democrat [Al Gore](/wiki/Al_Gore \"Al Gore\") carried Nashville with over 59% of the vote even as he narrowly lost his home state and thus the presidency. In the [2004 election](/wiki/2004_United_States_presidential_election \"2004 United States presidential election\"), Democrat [John Kerry](/wiki/John_Kerry \"John Kerry\") carried Nashville with 55% of the vote while [George W. Bush](/wiki/George_W._Bush \"George W. Bush\") won the state by 14 points. In [2008](/wiki/2008_United_States_presidential_election \"2008 United States presidential election\"), [Barack Obama](/wiki/Barack_Obama \"Barack Obama\") carried Nashville with 60% of the vote while Republican [John McCain](/wiki/John_McCain \"John McCain\") won Tennessee by 15 points.  \\nNashville was in a single congressional district, the [5th](/wiki/Tennessee%27s_5th_congressional_district \"Tennessee\\'s 5th congressional district\"), for most of its history. A Republican had not represented a significant portion of Nashville since 1874, until 2023 when the GOP-controlled state legislature controversially split Nashville into parts of the 5th, [6th](/wiki/Tennessee%27s_6th_congressional_district \"Tennessee\\'s 6th congressional district\"), and 7th districts in a partisan [gerrymander](/wiki/Gerrymander \"Gerrymander\") an additional Republican to Tennessee\\'s congressional delegation as part of the [2022 redistricting cycle](/wiki/2020_United_States_redistricting_cycle \"2020 United States redistricting cycle\").[[252]](#cite_note-261) This Republican gerrymander ‘cracked’ the Democratic stronghold of Nashville across three otherwise Republican districts, ensuring three Republican representatives. This gerrymander ‘diminished the influence of Black voters and other voters of color concentrated in Nashville’, by splitting them up and adding portions of the Nashville community into districts that are overwhelmingly white and Republican, thus diluting the voting power of Black voters in the state.[[253]](#cite_note-262)  \\nPrior to this gerrymander, Republicans made a few spirited challenges to the 5th district in the mid-1960s and early 1970s, almost winning the district in 1968. The last serious bid for the district while still a Democratic stronghold was in 1972, when the Republican candidate gained 38% of the vote even as Nixon carried the district in the presidential election by a large margin. The district\\'s best-known congressman was probably [Jo Byrns](/wiki/Joseph_W._Byrns_Sr. \"Joseph W. Byrns Sr.\"), who represented the district from 1909 to 1936 and was [Speaker of the House](/wiki/Speaker_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives \"Speaker of the United States House of Representatives\") for much of [Franklin Roosevelt](/wiki/Franklin_D._Roosevelt \"Franklin D. Roosevelt\")\\'s first term as president. Another nationally prominent congressman from Nashville was [Percy Priest](/wiki/Percy_Priest \"Percy Priest\"), who represented the district from 1941 to 1956 and was [House Majority Whip](/wiki/Party_leaders_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives \"Party leaders of the United States House of Representatives\") from 1949 to 1953. Former mayors [Richard Fulton](/wiki/Richard_Fulton \"Richard Fulton\") and [Bill Boner](/wiki/Bill_Boner \"Bill Boner\") also sat in the U.S. House before assuming the Metro mayoral office.  \\nFrom 2003 to 2013, a sliver of southwestern Nashville was located in the [7th District](/wiki/Tennessee%27s_7th_congressional_district \"Tennessee\\'s 7th congressional district\"), represented by Republican [Marsha Blackburn](/wiki/Marsha_Blackburn \"Marsha Blackburn\"). This area was roughly coextensive with the portion of Nashville she had represented in the state senate from 1998 to 2002. However, the 5th regained all of Nashville after the 2010 census.'),\n",

Nashville is sometimes referred to as the \"Athens of the South\" due to the large number of educational institutions. The city is also a major center for the healthcare, publishing, banking, automotive, and technology industries.
