The southbound lanes of I-75 are also accessible from an entrance ramp from this road. At this point, I-75 enters a large commercial area dominated by Hamilton Place and has an interchange with Shallowford Road about a mile (1.6 km) later. A few miles later, at exit 7, I-75 has an interchange with US 11 southbound, US 64 westbound, and SR 317 westbound and begins a concurrency with these respective routes. Turning slightly northeast, the Interstate crosses a Norfolk Southern Railway, and, at exit 9, SR 317 splits off to the east. I-75 then crosses a steep ridge, passing between the Enterprise South Industrial Park to the west and Collegedale to the east. A few miles later, in Ooltewah, US 11/US 64 split off at exit 11, where the route narrows to six lanes. I-75 then turns northwest and narrows to four lanes. ===', '<2-hop>\\n\\nBradley to Loudon counties === A few miles later, I-75 begins a steep ascent up the western slope of White Oak Mountain, where the northbound lanes receive a truck climbing lane.

I-75 then runs for the next several miles through a predominantly wooded and agricultural area and crossing a few ridges before reaching Cleveland at an interchange with APD-40 eastbound (US 64 Bypass [US 64 Byp.]), a bypass and connector to US 64. Running along the western edge of Cleveland, I-75 has an interchange with SR 60 about 4.5 miles (7.2 km) later, also crossing Candies Creek Ridge at this location, and, less than two miles (3.2 km) later, an interchange with Paul Huff Parkway, a major thoroughfare along the northern part of Cleveland. The Interstate then leaves Cleveland and enters rural northern Bradley County, running northeast. Beginning at this point and continuing for nearly 60 miles (97 km), I-75 is very straight and flat, with few curves. Nearly the entirety of this section also contains an extremely wide median, mostly separated by trees. In some locations, the north and southbound lanes are as much as a half mile (0.80 km) apart.

      "Reference: The Federal Highway Administration, originally known as the Bureau of Public Roads, played a significant role in the planning of Interstate 440 in Nashville. The highway was approved by this agency on August 24, 1956, as part of the Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1956, which initiated the Interstate system. Initially referred to as Segment #516, I-440 was included in the proposed Interstate Highways and bypass routes around Nashville during a public meeting on May 15, 1957. Despite its early planning, the construction of I-440 faced numerous challenges, including controversies related to its location and design. These issues led to multiple design changes and significant delays, making it the last segment of Interstate Highway planned for Tennessee by the 1956 Act to be constructed.

      "Contexts: ['<1-hop>\\n\\nInterstate 440 (I-440) is an east–west auxiliary Interstate Highway that runs through Nashville, Tennessee. It serves as a southern bypass around downtown Nashville, and is located on average about three miles (4.8 km) from the center of the city. I-440 is also known locally as the Four-Forty Parkway, and is designated as the Debra K. Johnson Memorial Parkway. At a length of 7.64 miles (12.30 km), I-440 runs between I-40 and I-24, and connects to I-65 and multiple U.S. Routes. Combined, I-440 and Briley Parkway, a controlled-access segment of State Route 155 (SR 155), form a noncontiguous inner beltway around downtown Nashville. Originally proposed in the 1950s, I-440 was the subject of much controversy related to its location and design, which resulted in multiple design changes and delayed the highway\\'s completion for many years. As a result, it was the last segment of Interstate Highway planned for Tennessee by the Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1956 to be constructed. After its completion in 1987, I-440 developed unforeseen congestion, safety, and surface issues, which prompted a reconstruction of the entire route that was completed in 2020. == Route description == The majority of I-440 is located below the level of adjoining streets and roads in an artificially-cut gulch. It contains three through lanes in each direction for its entire length, as well as auxiliary lanes in many locations. In 2022, annual average daily traffic (AADT) volumes on the Interstate ranged from 95,313 vehicles per day near the western terminus to 123,747 vehicles per day between I-65 and I-24. I-440 begins west of downtown Nashville at a directional T interchange with I-40 south of Tennessee State University and heads directly south. It immediately crosses a CSX railroad mainline and U.S. Route 70 (US 70, Charlotte Pike), but does not have an interchange with this route. About 1.5 miles (2.4 km) later, the Interstate turns southeast and reaches a partial cloverleaf interchange (parclo) with US 70S (West End Avenue), which is indirectly accessible from the eastbound lanes via a connector road. Turning further southeast and passing near Centennial Park and Vanderbilt University, the highway has a parclo interchange with US 431 (21st Avenue, South Hillsboro Pike) some distance beyond. I-440 then turns directly east and reaches I-65 south of downtown Nashville about two miles (3.2 km) later in the top level of a symmetrical four-level \"Spaghetti Junction\" stack interchange, which includes four flyover ramps. It also crosses another CSX line and US 31 (Franklin Pike) at this location, but this route is not accessible. Briefly entering the city of Berry Hill, the Interstate turns east-northeast and meets US 31A/US 41A (Nolensville Pike) about 1.5 miles (2.4 km) later at a final parclo interchange where it also passes under another CSX line. A short distance later, the freeway crosses a fourth and final CSX mainline and reaches its eastern terminus at a directional T interchange with I-24, west of the Nashville International Airport and about one mile (1.6 km) south of the eastern end of a concurrency between I-24 and I-40. As a result of this, I-440 westbound is directly accessible at this interchange from I-40 westbound, and US 41/70S (Murfreesboro Road) is directly accessible from the ramp that carries I-440 eastbound traffic to I-24 westbound. ==', '<2-hop>\\n\\nHistory == === Planning === The route that is now Interstate 440 had its origins in 1955, when the Interstate Highway System was being planned.

The Interstate crosses the Mississippi River twice: once at Memphis and again at St. Louis. == History == When it was realized that a national highway system was needed, the Federal Aid Highway Act of 1956 provided for a highway replacing the old US 66 which I-55 filled. I-55 was originally constructed in the 1960s, to extend a section of US 66 between I-294 and Gardner which had been converted into a freeway and had Interstate signage installed in 1960. During the rest of the 1960s, I-55 was built in portions throughout Illinois, eventually connecting St. Louis to Chicago, where it became the fourth direct route between them. As it goes southward, most of the Interstate was purpose-built during the 1960s and 1970s. The entire length was completed in 1979. == Route description == === Louisiana === In Louisiana, I-55 runs nearly 66 miles (106 km) from south to north, from I-10 near Laplace (25 miles (40 km) west of New Orleans) to the Mississippi state line near Kentwood. Approximately a third of the distance consists of the Manchac Swamp Bridge, a nearly 23-mile (37 km) causeway, often cited as the third-longest viaduct in the world. === Mississippi === In Mississippi, I-55 runs 290.5 miles (467.5 km) from the Louisiana border near Osyka to Southaven on the Tennessee border, just south of Memphis, Tennessee. Noteworthy cities and towns that I-55 passes through or close by to are Brookhaven, McComb, Jackson, and Grenada. This highway parallels US 51 in its path roughly through the center of Mississippi. The eight miles (13 km) from Hernando to the Tennessee state line coincide with the newer I-69. The Mississippi section of I-55 is defined in the Mississippi Code § 65-3-3. === Tennessee === I-55 in Tennessee lies entirely within the city of Memphis, passing through the southern and western parts of the city and providing a bypass of downtown for motorists who do not want to take I-240 and I-40 through downtown to cross the Mississippi River. The western portion of this highway, which passes through an industrialized section of the city, contains numerous low-clearance bridges and also a very tight 270-degree cloverleaf turn northbound at Crump Boulevard. The Tennessee Department of Transportation (TDOT) currently has an interchange improvement project for this portion. Heavy truck traffic heading to and from Arkansas in this area is hence directed to detour via I-240 and I-40. For the Tennessee stretch of the Interstate, the usual national freeway speed limit of 70 mph (110 km/h) is reduced to 65 mph (105 km/h). === Arkansas === I-55 enters Arkansas from Tennessee as it crosses the Mississippi River on the Memphis & Arkansas Bridge. It overlaps I-40 for approximately 2.8 miles (4.5 km) in West Memphis. After separating from I-40, I-55 turns northward and runs with US 61, US 63, and US 64 until US 64 exits in through Marion. I-55/US 61/US 63 continues north through Crittenden County through rural farms of the Arkansas delta, including an interchange with I-555/US 63 in Turrell.

All trucks carrying hazardous cargo through Knoxville are required to use I-640. It has a total length of 10.80 miles (17.38 km) and runs approximately three miles (4.8 km) north of downtown through the northern neighborhoods of Knoxville. For its first 3 miles (4.8 km), I-640 has a concurrency with I-75, although exits along this segment are numbered according to the former's mileage. For the rest of its length, the Interstate maintains an unsigned concurrency with U.S. Route 25W (US 25W). Both of these highways were rerouted from their original alignments upon I-640's completion. The route that is now I-640 was first planned by the city of Knoxville in 1945 and initiated by the Federal Aid Highway Act of 1956, along with most of the Interstate Highway System. Initial construction work began in the early 1960s, and for many years, only two miles (3.2 km) of the highway was open to traffic. Work on the remainder of I-640 began in 1977, and the last section was completed in 1982. == Route description == I-640 has three lanes in each direction for its entire length, in addition to auxiliary lanes between some interchanges. In 2022, annual average daily traffic (AADT) counts ranged from 70,244 vehicles per day at the highway's eastern terminus to 104,064 vehicles on the western leg. Unlike the other Interstate Highways in Knoxville, however, I-640 rarely experiences severe congestion. I-640 begins west of Downtown Knoxville at a semi-directional T interchange with I-40 and I-75, where the latter continues onto a concurrency with I-640. Along this section, I-640 is treated as the primary route, with exits numbered according to its mileage. Initially heading northwest, the Interstate immediately passes under State Route 169 (SR 169, Middlebrook Pike) without an interchange. A short distance beyond this point, the highway turns north and crosses a CSX railroad mainline, intersecting with SR 62 (Western Avenue) in a partial cloverleaf interchange a short distance later. It then veers northeast into the southern fringes of Dutch Valley, running along the northern base of Sharp's Ridge. About 1.5 miles (2.4 km) later, I-640 reaches an unusual three-level combination interchange, commonly known as the Sharp's Gap Interchange, with US 25W (Clinton Highway), I-75, and the northern terminus of I-275. A series of towering radio masts on Sharp's Ridge dominate the view to the south here. At this interchange, I-75 splits off, heading north towards Lexington, Kentucky, and US 25W and SR 9 begin an unsigned concurrency with I-640. Also at this interchange, SR 9 continues onto an unsigned concurrency with US 25W north to Clinton. The highway then shifts slightly east-northeast and, a few miles later, has a partial cloverleaf interchange with US 441 (Broadway). A short distance later, I-640 crosses a Norfolk Southern Railway mainline. Some distance later, the freeway turns almost directly east. It then reaches an interchange with Washington Pike and Millertown Pike; access between the two is provided via frontage roads on both sides of the Interstate. The highway then gradually shifts south and, a few miles later, crosses another Norfolk Southern mainline and US 11W (Rutledge Pike) without intersecting this route. I-640 then reaches its eastern terminus at a semi-directional T interchange with I-40 on the eastern outskirts of Knoxville.
